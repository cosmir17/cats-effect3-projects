# Http4s Techniques with Cats Effect

This repository contains various techniques and examples for using HTTP4S with Kleisli arrows in Cats Effect. These examples are collected from online resources, YouTube videos, and personal studies.

## Overview

[http4s](https://http4s.org/) is a minimal, idiomatic Scala interface for HTTP services. This project focuses on leveraging HTTP4S in combination with [Kleisli](https://typelevel.org/cats/datatypes/kleisli.html) arrows from the Cats library, all within the context of [Cats Effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/) for pure, effectful programming.
